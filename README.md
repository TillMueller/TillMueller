- eBPF implementations for performance testing and POCs of stateful eBPF programs, used in my Bachelor's Thesis
  - [https://git.gento0.de/till/ebpf-code](https://git.gento0.de/till/ebpf-code)
- Minimal kernel for virtual machine file injection via HTTP or using a filesystem overlay provided in the `initrd`. Created as part of my Bachelor seminar
  - [https://git.gento0.de/till/network-boot](https://git.gento0.de/till/network-boot)
  - [https://git.gento0.de/till/network-boot-http](https://git.gento0.de/till/network-boot-http)
- Additionally, I attended the following classes and created solutions for their respective assignments. However, since the same exercises are still used in at least some of them, these repositories are not publicly available
  - Advanced Topics of Software Engineering
  - Numerical Programming
  - Cloud Computing
  - Introduction to Computer Networking and Distributed Systems
  - Fundamentals of Programming (Exercises & Laboratory)
  - Functional Programming and Verification
  - Fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Laboratory: Computer Organization and Computer Architecture
  - Introduction to Theory of Computation
